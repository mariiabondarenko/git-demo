Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
